first and foremost,
time and time again, 
loud and clear, 
part and parcel, 
sooner or later, 
step by step, 
good and proper, 
the nitty gritty, 
short and sweet, 
hustle and bustle, 
take it or leave it, 
rise and shine, 
flesh and blood, 
sink or swim, 
sick and tired, 
mumbo jumbo, 
culture vulture, 
wine and dine, l
ive and learn, 
from rags to riches, 
tried and tested, 
time after time, 
all in all, 
beg steal or borrow, 
more or less, 
by and large, 
tall, dark and handsome, 
safe and sound, 
ups and downs, 
pure and simple, 
pride and joy, 
now and then, 
back and forth, 
wear and tear, 
down and out, 
tooth and nail, 
high and dry, 
odds and ends, 
song and dance, 
an arm and a leg, 
done and dusted, 
far and wide, 
rough and ready, 
through thick and thin,ï»¿
